1. Boolean is a conditional expression
examples: x=1, x+1==2
  x+y=z, x+z=y, y==z
  6//4==2
3. nested conditionals are conditionals whose branches can contain another conditional or "if" statement
examples:
  if x > 0:
    if x % 2 ==1:
      print("x is an odd number")
    else:
      print("x is an even number")
